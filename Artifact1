CWD is affecting the deer population, and how we hunters interact with the wildlife. While I am not a biologist, I am a passionate hunter and outdoorsman. I currently reside in North Dakota, But I do hunt regularly in South Dakota and Minnesota. I love all sorts of hunting in these states. I am posting links to these states CWD information for research purposes. Thank you for looking. Feel free to contact me through my contact me page.
