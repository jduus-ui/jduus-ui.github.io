          <p>The Chickadee. It is my favorite songbird. I am not an expert on the bird by any means. But I did have a random thought about it. "Do they have a winter range and a summer range?" I did some research and found that they were year long residence where they were. If they did move around it was not far at all.</p>

          <p>Below you will find a reference to another webpage that offers more insight to this beautiful bird.</p>
