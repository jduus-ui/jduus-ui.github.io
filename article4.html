Ethics Paper 4. 
By Jacob Duus November 2025

How to handle ownership, licensing, and attribution for text and images on my website. 
At first thought, I would say to avoid using other people’s content and work as much as possible. It just keeps things simple that way. If you use your own words, your own work, your own content, you can’t possibly take it from someone else. It eliminates plagiarism altogether. 
Now if I have to use someone else’s work on my website, at first thought, I would reference their work similar to a works cited page. It might not be a specific format, but it should be clear that I wasn’t the one who created it. I would do my best to ensure that the content or information would be credited to who owns it. Weather it is citing the source immediately in context, or citing it as a reference at the end of the page. It must be clear who it actually belongs to. 
The Bible says in Matthew 7:12, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” It’s the Golden Rule. I believe this ties into this specific scenario perfectly. If I were to create content, write articles or papers, I wouldn’t want other people or users to just copy and paste it then say that it was their work. I would want credit for what I did. Not have someone claim my work as theirs. The Bible also says in the Ten Commandments, “Thou shalt not steal.” Using other peoples work and claiming it as your own seems to be a type of stealing. 
In short, in order to respect or honor other peoples work, give them credit for it when you use it. And use it in the way they intended for it to be used. If you look up the laws for certain Creative Commons, and just simply follow the laws and guide lines. That should cover all the bases for using other peoples work.
