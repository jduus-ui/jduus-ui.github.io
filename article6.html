Ethics Paper 6 – By Jacob Duus 
November 2025
In fleet and grounds management position that I currently work in, I work with a surprising amount of sensitive information. Driver license copies, training documents, and even personal contact information all pass across my desk in one way or another. As artificial intelligence becomes more part of everyday operations, it brings some real conveniences. It also brings some blind spots that can get me into trouble if I am not careful. One of the biggest blind spots is how AI tools sometimes store or process sensitive information without clearly telling me what happens with that data.
A likely bias or blind spot in AI is that it often treats all information as equally usable. It does not naturally distinguish between a random question about lawn care and a document containing someone’s home address or driver record. If I upload those documents to an AI tool without thinking, the system might store the information or use it to improve future responses. Even if the developers promise privacy, the tool does not truly understand the ethical principles of handling someone’s personal information. It simply sees input data for use. 
A real-life example of this would be using AI to help organize vehicle maintenance files. If I ask the AI to sort or summarize documents, I could accidentally upload a driver’s private information. The AI might generate a useful summary, but it also might keep a copy of the file in its training or internal data. The blind spot is not intentional harm. It is the AI’s lack of moral awareness. It does not know the difference between an oil change record and a sensitive personnel document.
A simple safeguard I will use is a “no sensitive uploads” rule. Before using AI, I will review every file and remove or block anything containing driver information, license data, or anything that identifies a person. If I need help analyzing a document, I will create a version that hides the personal details. This safeguard is simple and straightforward, and it respects the privacy of the people I work with.
This approach to AI use ties to biblical teachings about justice and integrity. Psalm 106:3 says, “Blessed are those who act justly and always do what is right.” Proverbs 21:3 reminds me that doing what is right matters more than empty gestures: “To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.” Handling private information with care is part of doing what is right. It shows fairness, respect, and a commitment to justice in the work I do every
